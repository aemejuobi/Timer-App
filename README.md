# Timer-App

* You can enter the amount of time in seconds that you want to count down
* In addition to that, while the timer is active, you can pause it and input in a new time. It will start counting down from that new time.
* There is animation in the countdown that utilizes JavaScript and SVG (which was a first time for me).

The purpose of this project was to understand object oriented programming in JavaScript.
